Jason's dotfiles
================

The bootstrap script is based on [holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)'s
work.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jasonchoimtt/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles

# Set up symlinks and do some interactive configuration
./bootstrap.sh

# Install some dependencies (only for vim now)
./install.sh
```
